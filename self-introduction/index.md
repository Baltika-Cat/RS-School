[Baltika-Cat's introduction video](https://youtu.be/TYgSKXx_Bww)

Hi! My name is Dmitry, I'm thirty and I work as an electrician for low-current networks in "AVTOVAZ".<br>My Discord and Github name is Baltika_Cat, but as you can see, I'm not a cat, I'm a human.<br>I like to play chess, play computer games, eat delicious food and I like sports a little.

I graduated from Togliatti State University with a degree in electrical engineering of enterprises in 2015.

A couple of years ago, I studied Java in Javarush courses. I studied without any specific purpose, but just for general development.<br>
I am currently studying at RSSchool Front-end course with my wife.
Sometimes studying is very difficult, but my wife always supports me and gives me the strength to pull myself together and move on to the next task, for which I am very grateful to her.<br>
In the future, I would like to find a job in the IT field, because I like coding, I like to find solutions to difficult tasks and make them more elegant.

In the autumn, I graduated from stage-0 at RSSchool with maximum points. I really liked and remembered the Random game project. In this project, initially I wanted to follow a simple path and make an analogue of the game Flappy Bird in another setting. It was supposed to be a game about a kitten running against the backdrop of a cyberpunk city and jumping over hostile opponents.<br>
But when I was looking for assets and sprites, the idea of a 2D shooter came up, which I implemented. Now it's a game about a soldier shooting off all sorts of evil spirits. As part of the task, only one level with werewolves was implemented. And the implementation itself is lame in places. But I do not give up my hope to continue its development in the future: add levels, new enemies, diversify weapons, etc.<br>
Unfortunately, at the moment I don't have much free time to continue developing.
But I believe that I will definitely get it into shape)

Thank you for being with me during these wonderful 3 minutes, all the strength, success and kindness!) Bye-bye)
