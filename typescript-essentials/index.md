1. **Getting Started with TypeScript** - [badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/BaltikaCat-6963/QDR2UDXE?sharingId=172C5F42AC6EDE58)  
In this module, I learned how to install, configure Typescript and compile it into Javascript. This will help me expand the possibilities of working with Javascript.
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript** - [badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/BaltikaCat-6963/PTZBT894?sharingId=172C5F42AC6EDE58)  
In this module, I learned about Typescript variable types. For example, any, unknown (and the positive and negative sides of their use), enum, I also learned about static types. It helps to avoid errors that occur during the operation of the program due to incorrect variable types.
3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript** - [badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/BaltikaCat-6963/ZPFMJ382?sharingId=172C5F42AC6EDE58)  
In this module, I learned about the implementation of interfaces in Typescript. They help to structure the code. I also learned about type aliases. They allow you to increase the readability of the code.
4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript** - [badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/BaltikaCat-6963/N79YB3UF?sharingId=172C5F42AC6EDE58)  
In this module, I learned the differences in writing functions in Javascript and Typescript, learned how to make function parameters optional or how to assign them a default value. This knowledge can be very useful. For example, a small function that raises a number to a power. A number is passed as the first argument, and the default value is 2 as the second. Depending on the arguments passed, the result may not be the square of a number, but a cube. Or even something more.
5. **Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript** - [badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/BaltikaCat-6963/N79YLLKF?sharingId=172C5F42AC6EDE58)  
After studying this module, I had a wonderful feeling - as if I was learning OOP again using the example of Java. Classes, interfaces, access modifiers, even detailed machine examples.
This is a very important and useful module. The information it provides has a wide range of uses. For example, structuring code using interfaces, hiding variables using modifiers, which will help avoid errors when using the application by the end user, accessors that limit property changes - all this allows you to fully use the principles of OOP.
6. **Generics in TypeScript** - [badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/BaltikaCat-6963/9NSFAY3U?sharingId=172C5F42AC6EDE58)  
In this module, I learned what generics are and learned how to use them correctly. Generics are very important because they give the code flexibility, like the any type, but they allow you to avoid errors in the code that the any type leads to. Generics also allow you to write code that can be used repeatedly.
