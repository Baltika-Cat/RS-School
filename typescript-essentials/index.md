1. **Getting Started with TypeScript** - [badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/BaltikaCat-6963/QDR2UDXE?sharingId=172C5F42AC6EDE58)  
In this module, I learned how to install typescript. This will help me work with typescript.
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript** - [badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/BaltikaCat-6963/PTZBT894?sharingId=172C5F42AC6EDE58)  
In this module, I learned about typescript variable types. This information will be useful when working with large projects where you need to specify a specific type for a variable.
3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript** - [badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/BaltikaCat-6963/ZPFMJ382?sharingId=172C5F42AC6EDE58)  
In this module, I learned about the implementation of interfaces in Typescript. This knowledge helps simplify the code by describing the properties of objects in a separate place.
4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript** - [badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/BaltikaCat-6963/N79YB3UF?sharingId=172C5F42AC6EDE58)  
In this module, I learned the differences in writing functions in Javascript and Typescript, learned how to make function parameters optional or how to assign them a default value. This knowledge can be very useful. For example, a small function that raises a number to a power. A number is passed as the first argument, and the default value is 2 as the second. Depending on the arguments passed, the result may not be the square of a number, but a cube. Or even something more.
